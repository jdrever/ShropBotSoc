# What's been seen here?

The [NBN Atlas](https://nbnatlas.org/) provides open access to many of the UKs
biological records via a sophisticated [interface](https://spatial.nbnatlas.org/).
Using this interfact you can answer the question...
what's been recorded in a location? 
for all the records in the NBN collections.

However, often naturalists want to know about the most recent sighting
for their taxonomic group of interest.
Typically on a mobile phone at a specific site.

# Who was Captain Magenta?

![Captain Magenta](./docs/assets/img/captain-magenta.webp)

Captain Magenta was the former godfather of an organised-cybercrime syndicate
whom the Spectrum Organisation recruited into its ranks out of its realisation
that it would need a criminal mind to help it understand the criminal mind.
