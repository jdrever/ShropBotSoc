# What's been seen here?

The [NBN Atlas](https://nbnatlas.org/) provides open access to many of the UKs
biological records via a sophisticated [interface](https://spatial.nbnatlas.org/).
Using this interfact you can answer the question...
what's been recorded in a location for all the records in the NBN collections.

However, often naturalists want to know about the most recent sighting
for their taxonomic group of interest.
Typically on a mobile phone at a specific site.

## NBN Records Simplified

This application provides access to the same data but restricted to a single
dataset and simplified for a mobile device for use in the field.

The project is supported by the [Shropshire Botanical Society](https://www.shropshirebotany.org.uk/)
whose [NBN records](https://registry.nbnatlas.org/public/show/dp120)
can be seen via their [online flora](https://flora.shropshirebotany.org.uk/).
